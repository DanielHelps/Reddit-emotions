            <h2>What's happening here?</h2>
            <p>
                Reddit emotions is a website that shows the feelings of Reddit towards different subjects.<br>
                For a selected search term, an advanced machine learning algorithm calculates the "positivity score", 
                based on hundreds of search results for this term.<br>
                Each result is given a score to indicate how positive (or negative) it is, and all the scores are 
                aggregated, where a weighted final score is given to the search term.
            </p>
            <h2>What's this train button?</h2>
            <p>
                The train button allows you to help improve the algorithm! By indicating whether a random post is
                positive or negative (or neither), you can help train the algorithm further and improve its future scoring.<br>
                Go ahead and try it!
            </p>
            <h2>Should I register? What's the deal with that?</h2>
            <p>
                As a logged user, you will be able see past searches you performed and their scores.<br>
                I will also add more benefits for registered users, which will apply retroactively, so registering
                now can actually benefit you in the future :)
            </p>
            <h2>Nice background! Where is it from?</h2>
            <p>
                Thanks! Credit to the background goes to redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/drusinow2/">@drusinow2</a> who created it.

            <h2>Is this an open-source project?</h2>
            <p>
                Yes, this is an open source project. I uploaded the entire code to Github, so feel free to use
                any part of the code (just remember to give credit).<br>
                You can find the code by pressing the cute cat icon down below. <br><br>
